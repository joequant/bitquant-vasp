OPTIONAL CLAUSES

The following provisions are additions to this agreement, which may be
optionally added if specified in the term sheet

1. PAYMENTS TO SATISFY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM EXTRAORDINARY LOSSES -
In the event that the borrower or any related party receives
compensation, settlement, restitution, or any other payment to satisfy
any claims resulting from an extraordinary loss event, the balance of
the loan pro-rated by the amount received divided by the amount
reasonably claimable through extraordinary loss shall be due within
the grace period described in the term sheet.  In the event that the
borrower fails to pay this amount within the grace period, then
borrower shall be in default.

    A related party is any person maintaining a personal or business
relationship with the borrower from whom the borrower may reasonably
derive benefit from the payments associated with the extraordinary
loss event.

    An extraordinary loss event is an event or series of events
resulting in business losses to the borrower exceeding 1,000 USD
within five years preceding the loan agreement that would reasonably be subject to a claim against business insurance or public
relief measures regardless of whether the insurance was maintained or
a claim was filed.  By way of example, these claims would include but
not be limited to losses arising from fire, theft, fraud, accident or
business closure or limitation due to unforeseen catastrophe such as a public health emergency or public disturbance.

2.  DEBT SENIORITY - The debt arising from this loan shall be senior to
any general obligations of the borrower, and in the event that the
borrower has different debt obligations of different seniority the
claims arising from this agreement shall have the same seniority as
the most senior liabilities of the borrower.
