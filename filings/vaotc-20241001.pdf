\opening{Greetings:}

On this National Day, I would like to express my appreciation for your
efforts to develop the virtual asset industry in Hong Kong and look
forward the presentations and announcements that you may make in the
upcoming Hong Kong Fintech Week from 28 October 2024 to 1 November
2024 and at Consensus 2025 between 18 and 20 February 2025.

As patriots, we deeply love Hong Kong and China, and we all understand
the importance of promoting trade and development in the virtual asset
industry for the common prosperity and national security of the
Chinese nation. The Central Government has given Hong Kong its full
backing and support to develop Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area as a
center for the development of virtual assets and other new productive
forces, and I look forward with optimism to see how patriotic forces
in Hong Kong can carry out our sacred duties to the Chinese nation to
perfect and improve the capitalist system within Hong Kong and advance
Hong Kong's role as an international financial center for the common
good of all humanity.

I am pleased to have heard Legislator NG's Keynote Address at the
Bitcoin Asia conference on 12 April 2024 \footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmxuaumGuCE}}, which preceded my appearance
on the panel concerning Bitcoin Financialization in Hong Kong \footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXbseaj7t4I}}. Legislator NG's remarks
to the Bitcoin Asia conference was significant in that it expressed
the full support of the Hong Kong government and the Central
Government in promoting the virtual asset industry in Hong Kong, and
during the subsequent panel, I attempted to build on the message of
Legislator NG by encouraging blockchain, web3, and crypto companies to
do business with Hong Kong.

Furthermore, I found the discussion led by Legislature CHIU at the
Cyberport Web3 event about Hong Kong and the World on 7 September 2024 was helpful in understanding Web3 policy in Hong Kong. During the event, Legislator CHIU asked the panelists how the issuers of regulated stablecoins see their relationship with unregulated stablecoins,
including those issued outside of Hong Kong. This is an important question and one which requires careful thought.

Finally, I am concerned about recent press reports of people being
defrauded by persons through virtual assets.
\footnote{\href{https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3280031/hong-kong-scammers-use-fraudulent-crypto-shops-rob-13-investors-hk148-million}{Hong Kong scammers use fraudulent crypto shops to rob 13 investors of HK\$14.8 million}}
I am concerned about fraud and abuse in the virtual asset industry and
wish to find ways of eliminating fraud and dishonest businesses in
Hong Kong, while creating a positive environment for honest
innovation.

To achieve this, the proper regulation of virtual assets in
Hong Kong is best done by reference to the fundamental principles of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of "one country, two
systems" and the development of the capitalist system within Hong
Kong. As such, virtual asset regulation should begin from the
constitutional principles within the Basic Law.

{\bf As the fintech sandbox for the People's Republic of China, Hong
Kong must develop policies to promote both virtual assets in
traditional finance (tradfi) and decentralized finance (defi)
sectors }

In discussions concerning virtual assets, there are frequent
references to a fintech sandbox by which new and innovative ideas can
be experimented with. As patriots, we should recognize that the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region is the fintech sandbox for the
People's Republic of China.

Exercising the sovereign powers that have been entrusted to it by the
Chinese nation through the Constitution of the People's Republic of
China, the National People's Congress instituted the ``one country,
two systems.'' policy and adopted the Basic Law of Hong Kong, by
which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has special
constitutional rights and powers. These powers are intended to create
new and innovative legal systems in finance and international trade
for the benefit of the Chinese nation.

In contrast, to the socialist system as practised in Mainland China,
where the Communist Party of China exercises a leadership role in the
functioning of the national economy, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China practises the
capitalist system in which economic leadership lies in the hands of
the private sector in which the role of the state is limited. The
provisions of the Basic Law are intended to allow patriotic forces in
Hong Kong's maximum freedom and discretion in financial and capital
transactions and this is intended so that the private sector in Hong
Kong can exercise leadership in developing economic policies in Hong
Kong for the good of the Chinese nation.

As an international financial center, Hong Kong is the location where
different financial markets meet and interact within the Hong Kong virtual asset market. We can broadly divide the system into a formal traditional finance (tradfi) market, which is centered in the investment banks of Central and the hedge funds of Sheung Wan, and an
informal decentralized finance (defi) market, which includes the money
services operators and crypto traders in Tsimsatsui and Mong Kok and
also extends to include crypto-innovators in Cyberport and throughout
the world.

We note that the interaction in Hong Kong between the tradfi market and the defi market has geopolitical and national security implications. The formal tradfi market remains centered on the G7 nations, and the United States has used and will likely continue to use its dominance over the regulated
market to maintain global hegemony and to impose sanctions against
the People's Republic of China. We note that given the importance of the
US Dollar, the institutions regulated by the SFC and HKMA are required to
follow directives of the United States, such as sanctions against the Chief
Executive and members of the Executive Council or limits to trade with
other nations, even when those directives are not in the interest of the Chinese nation.

As the world moves from unipolarity to multipolarity, we believe that
the defi market will form the foundation of a new financial system
that will allow trade between the BRICS nations, and that the role of
Hong Kong, as well as our friendly rivals in Singapore and Dubai, will
involve connecting the G7 financial ecosystem with the new BRICS
financial
ecosystem. 
However, such a radical shift in the global center of power will require
new and innovative thinking within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
and we are concerned that the traditional regulatory philosophy of agencies, such as the SFC and HKMA, may not lead to the optimal set of regulations. The
SFC and HKMA are regulators of traditional financial intermediaries we are
concerned that such regulations will result in the overregulation of SMEs in the defi space. Given that Hong Kong is the financial sandbox of the People's Republic of China, such efforts may conflict with the provisions of the Basic Law.

{\bf Applying a tradfi regulatory philosophy to defi may result in inappropriate regulation and conflict
with the Basic Law}

Therefore, it is with much concern that we have read press reports that
the Securities and Futures Commission is considering joint licensing
of virtual asset OTC with Customs and Excise. \footnote{\href{https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3278116/new-hong-kong-crypto-scheme-could-see-changes-sfc-involvement-otc-rules}{SCMP
  New Hong Kong crypto scheme could see changes with SFC involvement in OTC rules}}


Given that we believe that a solid defi sector is necessary for Hong
Kong to maintain its position as an international financial center, we
are concerned about the regulatory philosophy of tradfi regulators
such as the SFC and HKMA. We are worried that these tradfi
regulators consider the defi market to be irregular and abnormal and
believe that it would be in Hong Kong's interest to eliminate the
unregulated defi market and create a market by which the only allowed
transactions are performed through the tradfi market. Finally, we are
concerned that the SFC's regulatory philosophy of using the best
practices from other jurisdictions may result in regulations that are
unsuitable for Hong Kong.

Many of our concerns have been amplified by the recent report by the report by Mario
Draghi to the European Commission on EU
Competitiveness \footnote{\href{https://commission.europa.eu/topics/strengthening-european-competitiveness/eu-competitiveness-looking-ahead\_en}{The
  future of European competitiveness – A competitiveness strategy for
  Europe Pages 4 and 65}}
In this report, Draghi cited overregulation and administrative burdens on SMEs as leading reasons for the lack of competitiveness in developing new European industries. These concerns should be especially relevant to Hong Kong, as much
of the regulatory philosophy of tradfi regulators has been to take regulatory
practices from other jurisdictions and implement them in Hong Kong. While standardization
improves the ease of business, there is concern in both the United Kingdom
and the European Union that overregulation and bureaucracy can lead to a lack
of dynamism.

As the financial sandbox for the People's Republic of China, concerns about overregulation are particularly relevant for Hong Kong. Because Hong Kong has not only the freedom but also the patriotic duty to advance and innovate in the area of finance, we must preserve the ability of the private sector to lead and to
innovate in Hong Kong within the capitalist system. Fortunately, these
concerns were in the minds of the drafters of the Basic Law of Hong Kong,
and they intentionally included provisions in the Basic Law to constitutionally prevent
overregulation and bureaucratic interference in the capitalist economy, and
these provisions should be of particular note to the Legislative Council.

{\bf Basic Law Articles 5, 112, and 115 must be considered in any fintech regulation}

We have noted that the tradfi regulators have attempted to regulate
virtual asset products by extending the reach of existing laws, such as
the Securities Futures Ordinance, as well as applying the regulatory
practices of other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and the
European Union to Hong Kong, in addition to adopting the regulatory
guidelines of FATF, FSB, IOSCO, and BIS. We also note that much of the
tradfi regulatory system was established during the period of British
administration in Hong Kong, and hence administrative practices within
these agencies may not have taken note of constitutional developments
in Hong Kong that have taken place after the resumption of the
exercise of Chinese sovereignty.

To preserve the capitalist system and Hong Kong's role as the
finance sandbox of the People's Republic of China, the laws of Hong
Kong contains constitutional protections that do not exist in the
United Kingdom, or indeed any other jurisdiction, as Basic Law
elevates the right to the free flow of capital and the free movement
of goods, intangible assets, and capital to a fundamental
constitutional right.

\begin{quote}
{\bf Article 5} The socialist system and policies shall not be
practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the
previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged
for 50 years.

{\bf Article 112} No foreign exchange control policies shall be
applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Hong Kong
dollar shall be freely convertible. Markets for foreign exchange,
gold, securities, futures, and the like shall continue.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall
safeguard the free flow of capital within, into and out of the Region.

{\bf Article 115} The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall
pursue the policy of free trade and safeguard the free movement of
goods, intangible assets, and capital.
\end{quote}

These constitutional provisions create limits on the types of regulation that can be applied to virtual assets in Hong Kong that do not exist in other jurisdictions and did not exist in Hong Kong before the transfer of the exercise of sovereignty to the People's Republic of China and make it impossible to copy virtual asset regulations from other jurisdictions for use in Hong Kong.

In other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom today or Hong Kong under British administration, the government
may regulate virtual assets by merely demonstrate ``Wednesbury reasonableness'' \footnote{\href{https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1947/1.html}{Associated
Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation (1948) 1 KB
223}} which in which a measure that serves the public interest can be
disallowed only if it is so unreasonable that no reasonable person
acting reasonably could have made it. Our reading of the response to the
SFC, HKMA, and FSTB toward public consultations suggest that these agencies
are using this legal standard to justify regulatory measures toward virtual assets.

However, when a fundamental constitutional right such as the free
movement of capital is at issue, the legal standard in Hong Kong is not Wednesbury reasonableness, but the proportionality principle by which the government must demonstrate that the limits on constitutional rights are proportional to the public good of the provisions proposed
\footnote{\href{https://www.doj.gov.hk/en/publications/pdf/basiclaw/basic15\_2.pdf}{The principle of proportionality and
the concept of margin of appreciation
in human rights law}}

In the case of Hong Kong, the requirements for proportionality are set
up through the Hysan test \footnote{\href{https://www.hkcfa.hk/data.json?src=pdf_printedcase_pdf&lang=E&case_court_sys=FA&case_type=CV&case_ser_no=22&case_yr=2015&i_doc_int_no=3}{Hysan Development Co Ltd and Others v Town Planning
Board (FACV 21/2015)}}. To be constitutionally valid, the following
must be true:

\begin{itemize}
\item the restriction or limitation must pursue a legitimate aim;

\item the restriction or limitation must also be rationally connected
to that legitimate aim;

\item the restriction or limitation must also be no more than was
necessary to accomplish that legitimate aim and

\item Where an encroaching measure had passed the three-step test, the
analysis should incorporate a fourth step, asking whether a
reasonable balance had been struck between the societal benefits of
the encroachment and the inroads made into the constitutionally
protected rights of the individual, asking in particular whether
pursuit of the societal interest resulted in an unacceptably harsh
burden on the individual.
\end{itemize}

These determinations would not necessarily be made by courts. Under
the principle of ``measure of difference'' the courts will rely on the
judgment of the executive and legislature to decide what is the best
option unless the measures or decisions are ``manifestly without
reasonable justification''\footnote{\href{https://www.hkcfa.hk/data.json?src=pdf_printedcase_pdf&lang=C&case_court_sys=FA&case_type=CV&case_ser_no=1&case_yr=2018&i_doc_int_no=2}{Fok Chun Wa v Hospital Authority
[2012] 15 HKCFAR 409}}.

In addition to the preceding four-step process, the Hysan decision
implicitly includes a ``step zero'' of determining that a constitutional
right has been involved. Although one might consider the argument
that Articles 5, 112, and 115 do not create judicially enforceable
constitutional rights, the negative impact of such an argument toward
confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial center would be
so severe that we consider that position to be untenable.

{\bf The peer-to-peer nature of the defi market introduces
constitutional issues under Articles 112 and 115}

We would note that all existing limitations on the free movement of
capital, such as the Securities Futures Ordinance or the regulation of
or VASP and money services operators under the Anti-Money Laundering
and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance involves licensing of
financial intermediaries. These can be constitutionally justified as
licensing of intermediaries does not limit the ability of parties to
perform an exchange.

To protect the investing community, the Hong Kong government can and
does limit the types of securities which can be traded through a
financial intermediary, but restrictions merely limit the manner in
which a virtual asset can be traded but does not limit the right of a
willing buyer and seller to trade the asset.

As with the current restrictions on what intermediaries are allowed to trade
securities, there are no constitutional issues with existing legislation
on money services. Although there are restrictions on how money
services operators can conduct business neither the Customs and Excise Department
nor any other agency of the Hong Kong government places restrictions on what
currencies can be traded, and indeed, any such restriction would be
an unconstitutional foreign exchange or capital control.

However, these restrictions, which may be constitutionally valid in a tradfi world where they merely affect how transactions can take place, become constitutionally problematic in a defi world where the restriction prevents
the transaction from taking place at all. Instead of merely restricting
the ability of intermediaries to undertake virtual asset transactions
or restricting imposing standards on how a transaction can take place,
restrictions similar to those placed on financial intermediaries when applied
to OTC trading would restrict the ability of a willing buyer and willing
seller to engage in a market transaction.

This would be an extraordinary limitation, which is
previously unknown in Hong Kong, and these types of restrictions would be
permissible only if there is some extraordinary public benefit, and this
requires that the Hong Kong government provide extraordinary justifications
for these restrictions after careful deliberation. The Legislative Council is the most appropriate forum for this deliberation.

{\bf Articles 112 and 115 places a duty on the Legislative Council to
ensure that limits on the personal freedoms are proportionate to
the public good}

In contrast to other jurisdictions where conflicts between individual
rights and the public good are mediated by the judiciary, the Hong
Kong judiciary has generally chosen not to address these issues
directly but instead to impose standards and processes by which other
parts of the Hong Kong government, in consultation with the general
public may make these decisions. While the courts will defer to the
conclusions of the legislature or executive under the doctrine of
``margin of appreciation'', the concept requires that some decision-maker
has given serious consideration to these issues.

Therefore, the ``margin of appreciation'' places a duty on the
legislature and the administration to justify its decisions. If the
legislature and the administration ignore the importance of individual
rights, then the courts will find it necessary to intervene. We believe that this would only lead to inefficiency and confusion, and
therefore, we believe that it is best for all concerned that disputes
involving constitutional rights are resolved by consensus *before*
legislation is enacted.

We believe that tradfi regulators such as the SFC, HKMA, and FSTB are
not appropriate forums for balancing the limits on the rights of
individuals with the public good. In developing policy, tradfi
regulators seek input primarily from existing industry participants.
This becomes problematic when constitutional rights are involved in
that the views of other stakeholders, such as existing OTC traders,
users of virtual assets, persons who have been defrauded or are in
fear of being defrauded must be represented.

We are concerned that many of the stakeholders involved in this have
motivations that are not constitutionally justified. In particular, we
are strongly concerned that licensing will be used to create a virtual
asset monopoly in Hong Kong, by which persons with licenses can create
artificial barriers to entry to prevent companies from entering the
Hong Kong market. While there is no shame in maximizing profit in a capitalist system, we are concerned that the goals of investor
protection and economic development will be used merely as a pretext
for creating a monopoly system by which licensing holders can exclude
new entrants from participating in the virtual asset market. We are
concerned that policies and regulations developed solely by the tradfi
regulators will place undue weight on the interests of existing large
financial intermediaries, and insufficient weight on small OTC vendors
or persons with businesses that have not yet been created.

Furthermore, we are concerned that the tradfi regulators may have
regulatory efficiency and international standardization as
goals. While these may be valid goals and may be valid means to
achieve public policy ends, these goals, in themselves, do not justify
the limitation of constitutional rights.

If the tradfi regulators are inappropriate forums for balancing
limitations on individual rights and the public good, this function
must be performed by some other body. While the courts will do as a
last resort, doing so through the courts will only add expense and
uncertainty. However, we are pleased to see the proceedings of the
Legislative Council and believe that its Subcommittee on Issues
Relating to the Development of Web3 and Virtual Assets, which is
chaired by Legislator NG, is the most appropriate forum for balancing
limitations on constitutional rights with the public good.

We are pleased that the Web3 subcommittee has taken its responsibility
seriously. We believe that the Basic Law mandates that to fulfill its
constitutional responsibility that the Legislative Council should not
confine its activities to merely polishing legislation by the
administration but instead seriously examine and document the answers
to the questions that are constitutionally required by the Hysan test.

Different persons may have different views as to the answer to these
questions, and we would like to present our view that a potential
licensing scheme on VA OTC, which is similar to that of the VASP
licensing system, which came into force on 1 June 2024, would not
rationally be expected to provide investor protection and develop Hong Kong as an international financial center, and is therefore unconstitutional under the Hysan test.

{\bf Based on the negative experience of recent VASP Licensing
  legislation, we believe that applying similar heavyweight licensing
  to VA OTC would not achieve legitimate aims of investor protection
  and economic development and would therefore be unconstitutional
  under the Hysan test}

Under the Hysan test, a proposed measure must have a legitimate
aim. The aims of investor protection and economic development are
undoubtedly legitimate. However, we note that the SFC has attempted to
justify its regulatory measures by invoking consistency with
international standards and to achieve regulatory consistency. While
these may be means to achieve legitimate aims, they themselves are
legitimate aims that would warrant limiting constitutional rights.

Furthermore, much of the motivation of the SFC is to create a consistent set of rules between the tradfi market and the defi market
and to prevent regulatory arbitrage between the tradfi market and the
defi market. While these may be legitimate means to achieve other
goals, these are not legitimate aims that would warrant limits on
constitutionally protected activities.

As far as whether the restriction and limitation are rationally
connected to the legitimate aim, we note that the legal standard is
whether the measure is rationally connected to the legitimate aim and
in determining whether a measure is rationally connected to a
legitimate aim, we must not look at mere hypotheticals but look at the
act consequences of previous legislation.

Because the restrictions on virtual asset service providers only affect custodial intermediaries, there are no constitutional issues
with existing VASP legislation. Because current VASP legislation
places restrictions only on custodial exchanges, persons who wish the
trade virtual assets can do so in forums other than through custodial
exchanges. In addition, in a custodial exchange, unlike a defi or OTC
transaction, there is the risk that the custodian may misappropriate
investor assets, and ensuring that an investor's assets are properly
safeguarding provides additional constitutional justification for the
VASP licensing scheme.

However, extending these restrictions to all OTC trading would make
trading impossible within Hong Kong, raising
constitutional issues. Furthermore, because VA OTC is generally done
on a ``cash and carry'' basis, there are generally no custody issues. Therefore, while VASP licensing is constitutional because
they are restricted to custodial financial intermediaries, applying similar license restrictions to VA OTC may be unconstitutional.
Specifically, adopting limits on VA OTC trading similar to the VASP
licensing system for investor protection and economic
development would be unconstitutional if it is established that the
VASP licensing system, while constitutional, has not achieved those
goals.

We fully support the new provisions in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance that create criminal and civil sanctions for virtual asset fraud. Furthermore, we supported the ``opt-in'' licensing system by which VASP providers that service regulated financial intermediaries should be held to specific standards
determined by the SFC. However, we believe that the legislation
requiring VASP licensing for all custodial virtual asset exchanges in
Hong Kong has proven harmful to investor protection and economic development.

The purpose of the VASP law was to protect investors against
fraudulent activity and to encourage the economic development of the
virtual asset industry. We believe that licensing has not accomplished
either goal. We note that Hong Kong was spared some of the worst
results of the FTX debacle as Sam Bankman-Fried closed his offices in
Hong Kong and moved to Barbados while Singapore licensees remained in
operation in Singapore. We further note that the JPEX Exchange scandal occurred
after the licensing system was instituted and that the existence of a
licensing system may have given investors a false sense of
security. We note that a licensing system can *increase* risks to the
investing public by making the investing public believe they have
higher protections than they do.

We also note that the SFC view of licensing assumes that Hong Kong
retail investors will exclusively trade with regulated local
exchanges. This has yet to happen and will be unlikely as
local regulated exchanges do not have the ease of use, trading
standards, or liquidity of offshore exchanges. We also have extreme
concerns about the commercial viability of the regulated
exchanges. None of the regulated VASP providers have reported a
profit, and it has not been demonstrated that there is a commercially
viable business model given the high cost of VASP regulation. A situation in which licensing merely causes investors to seek overseas
exchanges or results in such onerous conditions that regulated
exchanges are not commercially viable would not achieve legitimate
public aims and, therefore, would be an unconstitutional limit when
applied to direct peer-to-peer transactions.

We further note that the VASP licensing model, in conjunction with the
prohibition on capital controls in Article 112 has created an unusual
market structure in Hong Kong, which has been highly damaging to the
development of virtual assets in Hong Kong. Because Article 112
prevents the imposition of capital controls, the HK government cannot
prevent exchanges headquartered in Hong Kong from serving clients
outside of Hong Kong. Likewise, the Hong Kong government cannot
prevent Hong Kong persons from using exchanges outside of Hong
Kong. This has created an unusual market structure in which three sets
of exchanges:

\begin{itemize}
\item regulated exchanges based in Hong Kong which serve Hong Kong
residents
\item unregulated exchanges based in Hong Kong which do not service
Hong Kong residents
\item unregulated exchanges based outside of Hong Kong which service
Hong Kong residents
\end{itemize}

These three exchanges cannot trade with each other, which has the
effect of fragmenting liquidity and limiting Hong Kong's ability
to serve as a virtual asset connector. Furthermore, an exchange that
wishes to do business with Hong Kong persons and take advantage of
Hong Kong's role as a connector is perversely incentivized not to set
up its headquarters in Hong Kong. This results in exchanges setting up businesses in other jurisdictions, which negatively affects Hong Kong's development as an international financial center.

We do not doubt the sincerity and good intentions of the persons
involved in the VASP licensing system. However, when limits on
constitutional rights are being considered, sincerity and good
intentions are not enough. If the Legislative Council were to agree
with our position that the current VASP licensing scheme has failed to
either provide investor protection and encourage economic development,
then it would have the constitutional duty to block a similar
licensing scheme regarding virtual asset OTC, and consider alternative
regulatory mechanisms.

{\bf Other common law jurisdictions have limited the scope of virtual
asset restrictions in ways that are constitutionally relevant to
Hong Kong}

We note that in the public consultations, the SFC and HKMA have tended
to refer to standards issued by international organizations such as
IOSCO, FSB, BIS, and FATF. We believe that developing regulations in
reference to these organizations, one would take the EU-style
regulatory approach, which has been criticized in the Draghi report and
which is biased toward increasing regulation in ways that may be
counterproductive to innovation.

To counteract this bias, we wish to bring to the attention of the
Legislative Council, judicial decisions from other common law
jurisdictions that reduce the scope of regulation in ways that are
constitutionally relevant to Hong Kong.

Under Article 84 of the Basic Law, courts in Hong Kong may refer to
precedents of other common law jurisdictions when making decisions
about Hong Kong law. We would refer to a decision by the courts of the
Republic of Singapore and the courts of the Republic of India, which
limit the scope of virtual asset regulation, as well as decisions from
Australian law, which may serve as a guide for how constitutional
restrictions can influence economic policy.

First, as Hong Kong has a friendly and healthy rivalry with the Republic of Singapore, we can look at the restrictions the Singaporean courts have placed on the scope of virtual asset regulation. Specifically, the High Court of Singapore used the legal
criterion in the first payments case \footnote{\href{https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/gd/2023_SGHC_66/pdf}{Public Prosecutor v Lange
Vivian [2021] SGMC 11 (``Lange Vivia'')}} to significantly narrow the
scope of licensing requirements in Singapore. \footnote{\href{https://www.elitigation.sg/gd/s/2023_SGHC_66}{Rio Christofle v
Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm [2023] SGHC 66}} Specifically, the High Court
ruled that the mere trading of cryptocurrency did not constitute
engaging in the ``business of providing a payment service'' under the
Payment Services Act unless three criteria were satisfied

\begin{itemize}
\item that a profit had been made
\item the number of transactions in question was significant
\item and the role that the party played in the transaction as that of an
intermediary
\end{itemize}

Specifically, the High Court ruled that a party was not in the business
of providing a payment service if they were trading their assets.
This case was significant because it was a civil case
involving the validity of a civil contract. Since it is obviously
against public policy to have the courts enforce a contract to perform
an illegal act, the Singapore courts recognized that the Payment
Services Act could create legal chaos by calling into
question any contract involving virtual assets. Any person who wished
to challenge a contract involving virtual assets could argue that the
counterparty was operating illegally by trading cryptocurrencies
without a license.

To prevent this sort of legal chaos, the courts in Singapore have
narrowly construed the scope of the Payments Services Act. Although it
is impossible to dispute that the parties involved were not ``dealing
in payment tokens'' the courts have adopted a very narrow view of
``engaging in the business of'' to exclude from licensing situations
in which the parties are trading their assets and not acting as an
intermediary.

This case is relevant to Hong Kong law. First, the experience of
Singapore has illustrated some possible unintended consequences of
legislation, as restrictive legislation would call into question the
validity of civil contracts. Second, because Hong Kong is in
commercial competition with Singapore, we believe it would be unwise
from a competitiveness perspective for Hong Kong to have more
restrictive laws on virtual assets than Singapore. Finally, although
Singapore does not elevate the role of free capital flow to a
constitutional right, the fact that Singapore does not require
licensing in a specific situation would call into question the
necessity and, hence, the constitutionality of analogous restrictions
in Hong Kong.

Another case which we believe would be relevant to Hong Kong
is a case in which a three-judge panel of the
Supreme Court of India quashed a circular by the Reserve Bank of India
which banned cryptocurrencies. The Supreme Court of India has issued
subsequent rulings on the role of cryptocurrencies in India and Hong
Kong should look at these rulings in developing the law of virtual assets in Hong Kong.\footnote{\href{http://student.manupatra.com/Academic/Studentmodules/Judgments/MANU-SC-0264-2020-JUD.pdf}{Internet and Mobile Association of India v. Reserve Bank
of India (MANU/SC/0264/2020)}}

In these cases, the Supreme Court of India applied the proportionality
principle to Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution which states

\begin{quote}
All citizens shall have the right-
(g) to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade,
or business
\end{quote}

and struck down the restrictions by the Reserve Bank of India on
limiting the use of cryptocurrencies in India.

Although the Hong Kong courts have adopted a limited interpretation of
the analogous provisions of the Basic Law, namely Article 34 \footnote{\href{https://www.refworld.org/jurisprudence/caselaw/hkcfa/2014/en/99099}{GA and
Ors v Direction OF Immigration, FACV No. 7, 8, 9, 10 of 2013}} we
believe that the principles in the Supreme Court of India are relevant
to the development of virtual asset law through Articles 112 and 115
of the Basic Law.

Finally, examining how to develop virtual asset legislation in Hong
Kong, we believe that the legislature should not only look narrowly at
laws regarding virtual assets, but look at the principles courts in
other jurisdictions interpret constitutional principles enforcing
economic rights. For example, the High Court of Australia, in its role
as the highest court in Australia has extensive jurisprudence on
Section 92 of the Australian Constitution, which states

\begin{quote}
{\bf Section 92} On the imposition of uniform duties of customs,
trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means
of internal carriage or ocean navigation shall be absolutely free.
\end{quote}

There has been extensive jurisprudence on the meaning of Section 92
\footnote{\href{https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/18.html}{Cole v. Whitfield [1988] HCA 18}, \href{http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/46.html}{Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills
1992] HCA 46}, \href{https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2008/11.html}{Betfair Pty Limited v Western Australia [2008] HCA
11}}. In these cases, the High Court of Australia has introduced legal
principles such as reasonable necessity and proportionality in
economic activity, which we believe would be helpful for the
administration and legislature in determining virtual asset policy
in Hong Kong.

We note that several of the non-permanent judges in the Court of Final
Appeals from Australia and believe that their expertise in
interpreting Section 92 of the Australian Constitution would lead them
to favourably consider our interpretation of Basic Law Articles 5,
112, and 115 as applied to virtual assets in Hong Kong.

{\bf Any positive benefits of licensing can be achieved through less
intrusive measures}

We believe that a proposed licensing scheme for VA OTC, which is
similar to the VASP licensing system put in place for tradfi
institutions would fail the third and fourth tests of the Hysan
test. Whatever benefits may come from this form of intrusive and
heavy-handed licensing can be undertaken with other less intrusive
methods.

We believe that the regulated tradfi sector of the virtual asset
industry would benefit from clear regulations and support the efforts
of the tradfi regulators to introduce standards for financial
intermediaries. However, we note introducing standards for financial
intermediaries did not require new legislation and this public need
could have been satisfied with pre-existing ``opt-in'' licensing.

We do believe that the issue of VAOTC conducting marketing activities
on behalf of fraudulent scams is an issue that should be addressed,
but we believe that this would be better achieved through better user
education, increased enforcement of anti-fraud provisions, and the
development of self-regulation organizations. Furthermore, as these
are fundamentally criminal activities, we believe that the lead
agencies for this form of investor protection should be the Hong Kong
Police Force and Customs and Excise, which are under the Secretary of
Security.

Additionally, we have the following recommendations:

\begin{itemize}

\item We urge that the Department of Justice and the Constitutional
  and Mainland Affairs Bureau be actively involved in the drafting of
  VA OTC legislation so that any constitutional issues are resolved
  before the legislation is enacted to avoid legal challenges
  post-enactment,

\item To avoid constitutional problems, the Legislative Council should
  avoid "blank cheque" grants of authority to the
  administration. Should any limits on constitutional rights such as
  licensing be required, it should be made clear in the terms of the
  legislation what the purpose of these limits are is and the
  legislation should be focused toward addressing specific issues,
  
\item We believe in strong enforcement of anti-fraud and anti-scam
  provisions through both the Hong Kong Police Force and Securities
  Futures Commission. Our objections to the VASP licensing system do
  not extend to the anti-fraud measures that were introduced by the
  amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance,

\item We believe that the SFC and HKMA can and should regulate the
defi activities of existing financial intermediaries through
``opt-in'' standards and regulatory guidance,

\item We believe that existing holders of money lending, precious
stones and metals, and money services licenses should be allowed to
conduct virtual asset business under those licenses,

\item We believe that there is no reason for the Legislative Council
to introduce licensing of VA OTC. Should the Legislative Council
disagree and enact licensing, then it would be constitutionally
required to consider the Hysan test and must make particular efforts
to explain the necessity for such limitations on individual rights
to prevent possible future court challenges to the legislation,

\item If measures restricting constitutional rights are deemed
necessary by the Legislative Council, then the Legislative Council
must adopt restrictions with the minimum possible impact. For
example, Legco should consider a system of registration rather than
licensing. Alternatively, the current licensing system by Custom and
Excise toward money services and precious metals should be
considered for use as a basis for any licensing and registration
requirements,

\item Any licensing conditions must comply with the Basic Law Article
112, which forbids the HKSAR from instituting capital or foreign
exchange controls and these provisions prevent the HKSAR from
limiting what forms of money can be used in Hong Kong for VA OTC or
any other purposes. Therefore, while we support the proposed
legislation for regulating the issuance of stablecoin in Hong Kong,
we believe that it would be an unconstitutional foreign exchange and
capital control for the HK government to limit which stablecoins can
be traded OTC in Hong Kong.

\end{itemize}


{\bf We believe that a civil and rational discussion of the regulation
of virtual assets will be a demonstration of democracy and the rule of
law in Hong Kong and attract talent to Hong Kong }

Hong Kong has been subject to extreme changes as the world
changes. Among patriotic forces, there will be
contradictions. However, these are all of a non-antagonistic
nature. Furthermore, as patriots, we should be open to constructive
criticism and opinions from outside.

Our views on the negative impact of existing licensing schemes are
subject to debate; others may have alternative views. After hearing
the views of all those involved, the Legislative Council may decide
that our objections are invalid and proceed with legislation that we
believe to be unwise.

However, our main point is that although the Legislative Council may
come up with conclusions that are different from ours, a debate must occur for new legislation that limits constitutional rights to be valid in Hong Kong. This debate must happen in the Legislative Council
before the legislation is enacted or in the courts after it is
enacted, and we believe that it is more efficient and better for all
concerned that this debate occurs within the Legislative Council.

As part of the People's Republic of China and with the full support
and confidence of the Central Government, Hong Kong has developed a
robust constitutional framework for the free and democratic
development of public policy under the capitalist system, and I
believe that open, civil, rational discussion of virtual asset
regulation within the framework of the Basic Law that considers the
views and interests of all stakeholders will attract talent to Hong
Kong.

There is great dissatisfaction with the global financial system, and
the capitalist system of Hong Kong allows anyone willing to bear
allegiance to the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
of the People's Republic of China to develop those laws for the
benefit not just of Hong Kong or China but to contribute to the common
prosperity of humanity.

I have included a CV describing my background and contact information
and look forward to further dialogue and discussion on these issues
during the upcoming Hong Kong Fintech Week and over the coming months
and wish you a happy National Day.

The contents of this letter are public and intended to generate
discussion, as such I grant permission to publish and circulate this
