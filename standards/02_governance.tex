The key stakeholders in the firm are the clients who have entrusted
their money into the firm.  In contrast to many industries where the
client can be seen merely as a means for the firm to generate revenue

\section{Delegation of roles}
\crossref{VA1 Question 3}
\status{Fully implemented}

The firm will not delegate functions involved decision making and
custody to outside entities.

The functions that will be delegated are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cloud and server functions.  Running servers and the hardware
    infrastructure will be delegated to cloud providers.  However, all
    software will be run internally.
 \item Business functions.  The firm will use cloud SaS services such
   as Google drive and github for business operations.
 \item KYC and KYT information.  The firm will rely on outside
   providers to receive information concerning KYC and KYT.  However,
   these vendors will be used only for analysis and information
   provision and the firm will not use the firms to make decisions on
   clients.
\item The firm will rely on outside open source firms for development
  of software.  All software used by the firm will be open source with
  the firm having full source code access and ability to modify sources.
\end{itemize}

The functions that we will not delegate are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Custody of funds
  \item Operation of exchange software.  Our relationship with our
    software vendors is one of open source by which we receive source
    code from the open source vendors, but all operation is done by
    the firm.
 \item AML/KYC decisions or account management.  While we will rely on
   outside vendors to receive information on AML/KYC the decisions as
   to opening accounts will be made internally
\end{itemize}

The business operations outsourcing will consists of month-to-month
contracts.  Business operations will be outsourced to industry
standard entities for which no special due dilligence is necessary
(i.e. Google cloud or Github).

In cases where there are regulatory issues (i.e. storage of
confidential data) we intended to work with local industry
associations and other exchanges using the same vendors to insure that
we are able to comply with regulatory requirements.
