\section{Methodology}

This report is the External Assessor Report for \firmfullname.  It was
generated with the following methodology.

The first step was for the firm to create a operations and technical
manual indicating the intended operations of the firm once the firm
moves to a fully licensed framework.

The second step was for the firm to conduct an internal
self-assessment which consisted of a gap analysis indicating gaps
between the current state of the firm and the intended outcome.

One the firm has completed a self-assessment, the firm then invited a
team of external assessors to assess the self-assessment and then
using their expertise to come to an agreed action plan for upgrading
the firms operations to a completely licensed system.

The assessors are then able to certify:

\begin{itemize}
  \item That the intended objectives of the firm are sufficient for
    the firm to be licensed
  \item That the gap between the current state of the firm and the
    intended objectives are agreed to by all parties
  \item That the action plan and items necessary to bring the firm
    into full compliance are reasonable and can be achieved
\end{itemize}

The EAR Phase 1 report is then to be submitted to the Securities and
Futures Commission for review and comment.  After the consultation and
discussion and after which the SFC is satisfied with the objectives of
the firm, the SFC will issue an approval in principle.  At which time,
the firm will execute the action items in the Phase 1 report and a
team of external assessors will evaluate the completion of the
objectives for the Phase 2 report.
