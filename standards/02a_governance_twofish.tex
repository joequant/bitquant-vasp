\section{Governance of Twofish}
As a research laboratory, the organizational structure of Twofish is
designed to resemble that of university research laboratory than that
of a commericial business.  In particular, in order to rapidly conduct
research, the staff of the laboratory will consist of a principal
investigator and co-investigators.

We propose that the ``external assessors'' team that is assesses the
fitness of Twofish be made a permanent body with a direct reporting
line to audit and compliance functions.  There will be a non-executive
chairman which will monitor the financials and operations of the PI
and co-PI's, and also monitor financial risk and impact of the
research program to the wider community.

\subsection{Organizational structure}
In developing the structure of Twofish we will following a ``dual line
of control'' model, in which the principal investigator and
co-investigators will be responsible for the operations of the
exchange, while there will be a separate line of control which will
maintain financial and regulatory oversight.
