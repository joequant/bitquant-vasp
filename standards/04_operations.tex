\chapter{Operations}

\section{Basic principles}

\begin{itemize}
\item IT IS NOT YOUR MONEY.  IT IS THE CLIENT'S MONEY.
\end{itemize}

\section{Compliance and escalation policy}

All staff will be given

\section{Mobile devices}
All wallet and cash management will be done via mobile devices issued
by the company.  Staff are not to put wallets information on personal
devices.

\section{Account acceptance}

The types of accounts that we expect to open can be classified as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Retail accounts
  \item Corporate accounts
\item Financial intermediaries
\item Staff accounts
  \end{itemize}

Our main clients are expected

\subsection{KYC}

\subsection{Financial intermediaries}
We consider licensed financial intermediaries including money services
operators, family offices, and license brokers to be low risk,
provided that they are licensed in a reputable jurisdiction such as
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai.  It is our expectation that a
licensed financial intermediary would maintain adequate AML/KYC
protections to satisfy their regulators and hence it would be
unnecessary for us to add an additional level of AML/KYC.

Our main concern regarding due dilligence regarding financial
intermediaries is that they are who they say they are, and that they
the information that the provide is accurate.  In onboarding a
financial intermediary, the staff will check to see that the
intermediary is in fact licensed and that the person opening the
account is an authorized agent of the intermediary.  The staff will
monitor the intermediary with ongoing checks to make sure that there
has been no enforcement action taken.

\subsection{No cross-exchange, vostro, nostro accounts}
The company will not maintain an account with another exchange nor
allow another exchange to hold an account with the company, and will
not maintain nostro or vostro accounts.  Our main concern is that
cross exchange accounts will create ``hidden leverage'' in the
financial system and will cause leverage

\subsection{No third party trading for non-FI accounts}
Persons who are not financial intermediaries are not permitted to
trade on the exchange on behalf of third parties.

\section{Deposit process}
The deposit process consists of the user sending tokens into the
deposit wallet, and then the system moving tokens from the deposit
wallet into the accumulator wallet.  The trading system will generate
the keys of the deposit wallets, and these keys are stored encrypted
in the database.

The private keys of the accumultator wallet are available only with
the a senior manager, and should not be stored on the trading
platform.  Copies of the private keys of the accumulator should be
stored split in two and stored in the archvial location.

\section{Withdrawal process}

The withdrawal process consists of several steps.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Funds are moved from the cold wallets to the hot wallets and
    made available for withdrawal.  Typically this transfer should be
    made once per day and should consist of 120 percent of the average
    expected delay withdrawal volume.
  \item Withdrawals are approved by a staff member
  \item Withdrawals are then queued by the hot wallet and approve by a manager
\end{itemize}

\section{Trading rules}

process, and for hotline incident reporting.  All staff will be

For reporting of (a) non-compliance with your licensing conditions or
any applicable law, regulations, codes, guidelines, circulars or
FAQs, etc. we will maintain an internal reporting mechanism annd an
external reporting mechanism.

The firm will maintain an alternative reporting chain for
hotline/whistleblowing reporting.  There are two separate use cases.
The first is one in which the reporter believes that co-workers or
their immediate manager is operating in a non-compliant manner but
they have the confidence in senior management.  In this situation the
company will maintain a hotline to compliance and will prepare
compliance training material as to the internal compliance.

The firm will also maintain an outside tipline, by which staff can
report directly to senior management anonymously.

In situations, where staff does not have confidence in the ability of
senior management to deal with the situation, we will provide
compliance training materials outlining whistleblowing procedures by
which staff can contact the SFC directly and in our on-board materials
we will inform staff on whistle-blowing and legal protections that
they have.

\subsection{Suspicous activity procedure}

\status{Compliance training materials to be developed}

Staff will be trained to encourage a compliance culture with the
following process
\begin{itemize}
  \item Staff will be given compliance training as to how to identify
    and handle suspicious trading activity.  Staff will also be given
    compliance training concerning ``anti-tipping'' procedures and
    that any suspicious activity should not be raised with the client.
  \item In case, staff believes that there is a compliance issue that
    can be addressed by senior management then will be a hotline that
    will allow the staff to raise the issue with compliance
  \item Staff will also be given training on how to raise an issue
    with the financial regulators or law enforcement in case they
    believe that the issue cannot be resolved within the firm.  Staff
    will be given training as to their legal rights and obligations.
\end{itemize}

The firm will also maintain a robust client education procedure, by
which clients will be informed about the dangers of cryptocurrency and
fraudulent activity and about Hong Kong Police anti-fraud activities
through letters of no consent and Mareva injunctions.

\subsection{Technical incident reporting}

\status{Compliance training materials to be developed}

For routine reporting, the reports are to be made to the department
head, who will deliver reports to the responsible officer who will
then serve as a single point of contact with the SFC.  This procedure
will be used in situation where there are (c) material failures or
interruptions of trading, accounting, clearing, or settlement systems
or (d) material issues identified by outside experts or consultants.
