\chapter{Development and growth}

\section{Market structure}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 13a}
\status{To be created}


We have found that token issuance is generally listed on the basis of
a white paper and we are intent on using the new decentralized world
to create a healthy marketplace for tokens.

We believe that one of the public policy goals of the efforts to make
Hong Kong a virtual asset hub is to create new avenues for capital
raising for small high tech companies.  We believe that the processes
and procedures involved will be very much unlike those of the current
IPO process.  Among the issues which we are considering are as
follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item  {\bf Transparency of information} The goal of regulation is to make
  sure that investors make rational decisions in response to good
  information, and that all investors have access to fair and
  transparent information.

\item  {\bf Business models} One fundamental question is how the
  intermediaries get fairly compensated in ways that promote economic
  growth.

\item  {\bf Tension between impartiality and anti-competition} We would
  like to alert the regulators about the likely tension between
  impartiality and anti-competition.  In order to maintain an orderly
  marketplace, it may be in the public interest to have decisions on
  token issuance be made by a industry standards group.  However such
  a group can easily lead to monopolistic or anti-competitive
  behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Token admission policy}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 13a}
\crossref{Appendix F1: Part B}
\status{To be created}

Tokens will be added onto the exchange only upon the recommendation of
an independent token admission board.  As we have no current plans to
list new tokens, we have not yet created such a listing committee.

The token admission committee will consist of the following members
who are appointed by and responsible to the board of directors, and
will exclude any persons with a direct commercial interest in the
listing of the token.

\begin{itemize}
  \item one member with regulatory and compliance background
  \item one member with background in decentralized finance and
    financial services
  \item one member with background in traditional finance
  \item one member with technical/coding background
  \item one member with consumer production background
\end{itemize}

The token admission committee will have a executive director and a
social media coordinator.

We expect that the members will be persons who are either retired from
distinguished careers or persons with academic backgrounds.  The names
of the members of the token review board are to be made public, and we
intend to have a public discussion board by which members of the
public can discuss which tokens and propose the addition of new
tokens.

One thing that we will try to do is to create open processes by which
our exchange is directly engaged with the investing community through
forums such as social media.

\section{Due diligence}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 13b}
\status{Implementation in progress}

We expect that any tokens that we are listing will have already been
listed on a decentralized finance exchange.  Typically, a token issuer
will issue information in the form of a white paper, and we will
examine the white paper and public documents issued by the token
issuer, and gauge the sentiment of the investing public.

In some cases, we may contact the token issuer directly for
information.  However, in the interests of transparency wish to avoid
as much as possible the use of non-public information, and if we are
in a situation where we do not have sufficient information to list the
token, we would prefer that the issuer supplement their white papers
and public documents rather than engage in non-public discussions with
the exchange.

\section{Highly liquid assets}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 13c}
\status{Fully implemented}

The decision to classify an asset as highly liquid will be made by the
operations director after consultation with staff.  We do not believe
that this will be a controversial decision and if there is any doubt
as to whether or not an asset is a highly liquid large cap asset then
the determination is that it is not likely to be such.

In determining whether an asset is highly-liquid large-cap we will
use industry standard valuation boards including
\begin{itemize}
\item CoinMarketCap
\item CoinGecko
\item CryptoCompare
\item CoinCap
\item LiveCoinWatch
\item Coinlib
\end{itemize}

\section{Suspension and withdrawal from trading}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 13d}
\status{Fully implemented}
We believe that the most likely situation under which an asset will be
withdrawn from trading are situations in which there is some adverse
market disruption.  In this case the decision to suspend an asset from
trading will be done by the operations manager who will report the
decision to the managing director.

We note that because there are multiple exchanges, the decision by one
exchange to stop trading will not result in the removal of a market
for tokens, and hence in a particular exchange, the decision to stop
trading can be done by a single person and the existence of other
exchanges will provide check and balance in the system.

In determining whether a token is to be suspended from trading, the
operations manager would need to be guided by balancing the necessity
of maintaining a liquid market for a token versus issues of market
manipulation, fraud, and consumer protection.


\section{Anomalous incidents}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 14}
\status{Fully implemented}
In situations where there is adverse information or anomalous trading,
time and speed are of the essence, and we will set up an emergency
meeting by the operations manager and the managing director to deal
with this situation.  The principle that we will use is that we will
allow continued trading unless we believe that continuing trading will
result in fraud, undue enrichment, or market manipulation.

In cases where the trading is suspended, we will allow for client
withdrawals of tokens unless we believe that there is some underlying
issue with the blockchain which would allow for the furtherence of
fraud.

One issue that we will have to deal with is rules for coordinating our
activities with those of other exchanges.  In case of severe market
disruption, there will be a need for coordinated exchange action,
however such communications may lead to anti-competitive behavior.  We
would appreciate a mechanism by which exchanges can communicate with
each other and with regulators in cases of market disruption.

\section{Compensation for list virtual assets}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 15}

We are not compensated for list tokens and do not intend to accept
listing fees.  Because we are not charging listing fees, we cannot
support a heavyweight listing process, and so we would encourage
tokens that wish to be listed to present the information that we would
need to list in a public and transparent fashion.

\section{Current tokens traded}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 14}
\status{Fully implemented}
Right now, all of the tokens we trade are highly liquid large-cap
virtual assets.

\subsection{Aircrops and hard forks}
\crossref{VA-1: Question 16 and VA-1: Question 33}
\status{Terms and conditions to be written}
We will make very clear to our clients that they will not receive any
new tokens from airdrops and hard forks, and that any new tokens
created in company wallets will be credited to the company.

In case of an impending airdrop and hard fork we will inform our
clients of our policies and then facilitate their withdrawal of tokens
into their accounts so that they can take advantage of airdrops and
hard forks.
