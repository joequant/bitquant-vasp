6. Scope of assessment
a) First-phase Assessment - external assessment on design effectiveness
First-phase Assessment should focus on the design effectiveness of the
VA trading platform’s proposed structure, governance, operations,
systems and controls. The external assessor should review and assess
whether the platform operator’s policies and procedures are clearly written
and comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements,
including but not limited to the Guidelines for VA Trading Platform
Operators and the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Financing of Terrorism (For Licensed Corporations and SFC-licensed VA
Service Providers). Please refer to Appendix 1 for the areas to be
covered.
b) Second-phase Assessment - external assessment on implementation of
systems and controls
Second-phase Assessment should focus on the implementation and
effectiveness of the actual adoption of the planned policies, procedures,
systems and controls. Final approval of the licence application will be
granted subject to, among other things, the SFC being satisfied with the
result of the Second-phase Assessment. Please refer to Appendix 2 for
the areas to be covered.

Appendix 1
First-phase Assessment – assessment on design effectiveness
I. Format of assessment report
The assessment report should cover the following items:
• Executive summary
• Expertise, experience and track record of the external assessor(s)
• Scope/areas of the assessment
• Limitation of the assessment
• Approach to the assessment
• Description of the relevant structures/processes/policies/procedures/
systems/control of the specific areas that have been assessed and the
approach and assessment procedures carried out by the external assessor(s)
• Detailed findings and recommendations in areas of non-compliance with the
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and the actions taken (or
planned to be taken together with a specified timeline) by the platform
operator to rectify the matters
II. Areas to be covered
While the actual scope of areas to the covered under the First-phase Assessment
may vary depending on the business and operations of a platform operator, the SFC
expects the First-phase Assessment to cover, at least, the following areas:
Part A – Governance and staffing
(i) providing an organisational chart depicting the proposed management and
governance structure, business and operational units and key human
resources of the platform operator and their respective reporting lines;
(ii) confirming the adequacy and appropriateness of the proposed corporate
governance and staff resources, taking into account the specific nature of VA
trading activities;
(iii) with respect to personnel competency, assessing and confirming that
members of the senior management of the platform operator have the
relevant industry experience, qualifications, technical expertise, and know-
how for the key business functions for which they are responsible;
(iv) confirming that there will be a sufficient number of suitably qualified and
experienced professionals for each business function, with supervisory and
reporting responsibilities assigned to appropriate staff members;
(v) identifying the key personnel and confirming that an effective plan will be in
place to mitigate key-man risks; and
(vi) confirming that members of the senior management fully understand the
nature of and risks associated with the VA trading business, the applicable
legal and regulatory requirements, and the extent of their own authority and
responsibilities.
4
Part B – Token admission
(i) confirming that a token admission and review committee composed of the
required members will be set up with a transparent, fair and properly
documented decision-making process and with mechanisms for regular
reporting and ongoing monitoring of admitted VAs; and

policies and governance procedures and operational flow of VA transfer
between different wallets;
(ii) confirming that client assets will be protected in a way comparable to the
standards expected of traditional financial institutions. In particular, the report
should confirm that:
a. effective controls will be in place to ensure 98% of client VA will be stored
in cold storage;
b. there will be detailed specifications and proven processes for how access
to cryptographic devices or applications will be authorised and validated,
covering key generation, distribution, storage, use and destruction, and
how a signatory’s access could be immediately revoked as required;
c. there will be a detailed mechanism with sufficient checks and balances
and controls for transfer of VA between hot, cold and other storages, and

restricted among authorised personnel, and no single personnel of the
platform operator will have possession of information on the entirety of the
seeds, private keys or backup passphrases, and controls will be
established and implemented to mitigate the risk of collusion among
authorised personnel of the platform operator;
5
c. access control to backups of seeds or private keys will be stringent, and
will be kept and distributed in a manner which mitigates any single point of
failure and ensures that they cannot be re-generated based solely on the
backups stored in the same physical location; and
d. seeds and private keys will be stored in Hong Kong;
(iv) providing an assessment of the storage method to be implemented by the
platform operator to store client VA (taking into account the new
developments in security threats, technology and market conditions), and
confirming that the wallet storage technology will be fully tested before
deployment to ensure reliability;
(v) confirming that there will be adequate processes in place for safe handling of
deposit and withdrawal requests for client VA to guard against risks involved
in the process (eg, loss arising from theft, fraud and other dishonest acts,
professional misconduct or omissions), in particular, confirming that:
a. there are clear processes in place to evaluate the potential impact and
risks of these developments as well as for handling fraud attempts
specific to distributed ledger technology;
b. there is a mechanism in place to check and monitor client IP addresses
and whitelist client wallet addresses used for deposit and withdrawal by
using appropriate confirmation methods;
c. policies and procedures are in place to ensure any decision to suspend
the withdrawal of client VAs will be made on a transparent and fair basis,
and the platform operator will inform the SFC and all its clients without
delay; and
d. there will be processes in place to guard against fraudulent requests or
requests made under duress, or controls to prevent personnel of the
platform operator from transferring assets to wallet addresses other than
the whitelisted addresses; and
(vi) confirming that there is a robust process to prepare, review and approve
reconciliations of client assets in a timely and efficient manner, reconciliations
will be checked and reviewed by appropriate staff members, and material
discrepancies and long outstanding differences will be escalated to senior
management on a timely basis for appropriate action.
Part D – Know-your-clients (KYC)
(i) explaining the proposed KYC policies and procedures (including any
technologies to be deployed in the process), and explaining the operational
flow that illustrates different stages in the KYC process (including
identification and verification, signing of client agreement, disclosure to
clients, data collection and usage, escalation/reporting, etc);
(ii) confirming that the proposed KYC policies and procedures fall within the
acceptable account opening approaches under the relevant regulatory
requirements;
6
(iii) confirming that a comprehensive pre-implementation assessment covering
the required scope has been performed by qualified and independent external

identity of clients, financial situation, source of funds/wealth, investment
experience and investment objectives;
(v) confirming that there is a process in place to assess the client’s knowledge of
VAs before providing any services to the client, and to handle clients which do
not possess such knowledge;
(vi) confirming that there is a process in place to assess the client’s risk tolerance
level and risk profile and determine the risk profile and assess whether it is
suitable for the client to participate in the trading of VAs; and
(vii) confirming that there is a process in place to set a limit for each client to
ensure that the client’s exposure to VAs is reasonable, as determined by the
platform operator, with reference to the client’s financial situation and
personal circumstances.
Part E – Anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
(i) explaining the proposed AML/CFT policies, procedures and controls
(AML/CFT systems);
(ii) confirming that the proposed AML/CFT systems are adequate and
appropriate to manage and mitigate the money-laundering and terrorist-
financing (ML/TF) risks and ensure compliance with the regulatory
requirements, in particular, confirming that there are adequate and
appropriate AML/CFT systems in place to comply with the requirements on:
a. customer due diligence measures (including simplified due diligence and
determination of jurisdictional equivalence; all specific requirements
covering high risk situations, customer that is not physically present for
identification purposes and politically exposed persons; requirements for
obtaining additional customer information as appropriate; and additional
due diligence measures for cross-border correspondent relationships);

d. third-party deposits and payments (including ascertaining the customer’s
ownership or control of the account maintained with the ordering or
beneficiary institution, or the unhosted wallet); and
(iii) confirming that the proposed AML/CFT systems would enable the platform
operator to:
7
a. adopt a risk-based approach having due regard to the regulatory
requirements (eg, the list of non-exhaustive illustrative risk indicators for
assessing ML/TF risks) when conducting institutional risk assessment and
customer risk assessment; and
